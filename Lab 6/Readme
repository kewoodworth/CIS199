Prompt:

Create and test a Windows Forms application that implements a GUI-based solution to Programming Exercise 6-7 from 
p. 261 of the text. The Nimble Fingers Typing School assigns grades based on words typed per minute, as shown in the 
table below.

Words typed	Grade
0–15	F
16–30	D
31–50	C
51–75	B
76 and over	A
Create a GUI application that allows a user to enter a student’s number of words typed. Make sure the user's input 
is valid, otherwise prompt them to correct their mistake using a MessageBox. The output is the letter grade earned by 
the student. The design of the application's interface is up to you. You must use parallel arrays and range matching 
(not simply a series of if/else if statements), as in the class example from the PowerPoint presentation from Chapter 6.
