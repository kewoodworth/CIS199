Prompt:

Create and test a Windows Console application that displays the following patterns separately, one after 
the other. You MUST use nested for loops to generate the patterns, like the example in the PowerPoint slides 
from this chapter. All asterisks (*) should be displayed by a single statement of the form Console.Write("*"); 
which causes the asterisks to display side by side. A statement of the form Console.WriteLine(); can be used to 
move to the next line. A statement of the form Console.Write(" "); can be used to display a space for the last 
two patterns. There should be no other output statements in the application, other than labeling each pattern.
The application's output should look like the following:

Pattern A

*
**
***
****

Pattern B
