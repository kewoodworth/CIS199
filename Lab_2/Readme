Prompt:

Create and test a Windows Forms application that serves as a tip calculator. The user will enter the price of 
their meal and the application will calculate and display tips for 15%, 18%, and 20%. Specifically, the application 
must have:
A Form titled "Lab 2".
A Label titled "Enter price of meal:" next to a TextBox that will gather this information from the user.
Labels for "15%", "18%", and "20%" next to output Labels. Remember, for output labels, you'll need to change the 
AutoSize and BorderStyle properties (as demonstrated in class).
A Button titled "Calculate Tip" with an event handler (as in Figure 3-10 of your text) that calculates and displays 
the three tip amounts using currency formatting. Remember, magic numbers are to be avoided. Use named constants, 
such as TIPRATE_LOW or TIPRATE1 instead of literals like .15, or .18m, etc. See p. 80-81 of your text for how to 
do this.
