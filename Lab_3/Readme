Prompt:

Create and test a Windows Forms application that calculates and displays several geometric values of a sphere given 
its radius. The user will enter the sphere's radius (as a double) and the application will calculate and display the 
sphere's diameter, surface area, and volume. Specifically, the application must have:
A Form titled "Lab 3". Remember, the form's Text property controls the information displayed in the form's title bar. 
Change the form's Size to 400 x 400 pixels.
A Label titled "Radius of sphere:" next to a TextBox that will gather this information from the user.
Labels for "Diameter", "Surface Area", and "Volume" next to output Labels. Remember, for output labels, you'll need to 
change the AutoSize and BorderStyle properties (as demonstrated in class).
A Button titled "Calculate" with an event handler (as in Figure 3-10 of your text) that calculates the sphere's diameter, 
surface area, and volume using the formulas given below. Display these values with 2 digits of precision. This button 
should also be designated as the form's AcceptButton so that it will respond when the user presses enter.
